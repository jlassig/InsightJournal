# Overview

This is a continuation of my Kotlin and Android Studio Insight Journal application (the videos for the first two are 
at the bottom of this Readme). Here I've added a Firestore database. This allows users to login. The entries that the
user writes are saved to their individual profile. The user can add an entry, view their entries, update an entry, 
and delete an entry. When the entries are displayed, they are queried by the user ID and then sorted in descending order by date.

* Add more insights besides just the Mood tracker.
