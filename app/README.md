# Overview
This is a continuation of my Kotlin Journal Project (the video for that is at the bottom of this Readme). 
In this project I ported some of the code from IntelliJ
into Android Studio to be able to get the app off the console and into an Android mobile app.
This is a Journaling app where the user can either write to a random prompt, or the user can
enter their mood and what is on their mind and write about that. When they do the latter,
the app tracks their moods and gives them some insight into the most frequent mood per month 
as well as what they were thinking about at the time. 

I wanted to take my original Kotlin/IntelliJ program to the next level. Most people don't want to write to the console
when they think of writing in a journaling app.

# Future Work
* Add database functionality to have a way to log in to see the entries. 
* Add logos, pictures and some background screens so it isn't so utilitarian
* Add more insights besides just the Mood tracker.
